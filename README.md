# Trading Ports: Ships, slips, docks, and so on

## High level goals
- Implement a REST API to track ships as they travel between docks and through the sea
- Develop and deploy on standard cloud technologies, with a test driven approach.

## Inspiration
We are extending an assignment for [CS 496](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/ecampus-video/CS496/syllabus/index.html) at Oregon State University.

## Services/technologies used
- Jenkins
- Flask
- SQL

## Potential services to explore
- Postman
- Docker

## Code for sub-projects
- [Boat visualizer](ui)
- [REST API](rest-api)
- [Docs](Resources)
